# Joystick COM-09032 Breakout Board

Breakout board for the COM-09032 Joystick.

Includes a footprint for the component which is surprisingly hard to come by.
The datasheet from Sparkfun includes no measurements of any use, which is a
tragedy, and the footprints I've found online do not quite match the physical
measurements I've taken on a real device.

Not the world's most beautiful footprint, but serviceable.
